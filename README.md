### Project Description
A website that makes gifting your loved ones who live far away easier. It collects data of giftshops available in a given location and filters it according to the person's interests. We can also send personalized handwritten notes. We also aimed to make it more personalized by adding the option of sending spotify/voice messages as barcodes along with the gifts.

### The Problem statement
We realise how challenging it could be to gift our loved ones who stay far away from us.

### The Solution
We attempted to create a medium through which the miles of distance can be bridged. We have attempted  to make a website that inputs the location of the recipient and suggests gifts based on their personal interests that can be easily accessed by someone from anywhere in the world. We've also tried to include handwritten notes and spotify/voice message barcodes to add a personal touch and make the gifts even more meaningful.
